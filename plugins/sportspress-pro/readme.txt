Extend SportsPress with advanced club management modules.

== Description ==

= Advanced Club & League Management =

Equip your website with advanced tools to stand out from the crowd. Hit the ground running with SportsPress Pro and be the envy of your league.

Intuitive Software built by the developers at ThemeBoy. Imagine your sports website on steroids, without the 'roids – 100% beautifully written code.

SportsPress will keep record of your club's history for years to come, operating as the core database and your secret weapon.

= Tournaments =

Quickly setup your upcoming tournament and schedule matches from the first round. Select the dates, times, and who's playing who. SportsPress Pro does the rest.

Create up to six rounds and watch your team make it through the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and to the final match. You can even choose a name for each round!

Once you publish the tournament, your fans can see how your team is progressing through the bracket. Watch teams get eliminated from the knockout cup while winners move on the next round and make it to the finals!

The brackets are generated using code that can be scaled down elegantly without decreasing size or legibility. When on smaller devices, you can quickly scroll sideways to see the rest of the bracket.

Once the final match is played, update the results and declare the champion of the tournament! Your tournament bracket will display the winning team’s logo at the top of the bracket to show who won this season.

= Sponsors =

Register each sponsor by simply uploading a logo. Optionally add a link to their website and a detailed profile using the standard WordPress page editor.

You can choose whether clicking sponsors will send your visitors to a custom page where they can read more, or just directly link to their website for a quick referral.

Quickly add sponsors to your website in all the right places. You'll be able to customize the size of sponsor logos, sort order, position, and the number of sponsors you’d like to display in the footer or header of your website.

The included widget will also allow you to display sponsors in the sidebar or any widget area. Choose the size of the logos and their order. You can even display a random sponsor on every page load!

Find out who’s your most popular sponsor! From your admin panel, you’ll be able to see which of your sponsors are getting the most clicks and impressions.

= Team Colors =

SportsPress Pro makes it easy for you to customize the color palette for each of the teams on your site. Behind the scenes, a color palette is displayed below each team's logo so you'll easily be able to pick and choose which colors you want to show.

Once you’ve chosen a color scheme for a team, their profile page will automatically reflect those colors without you having to add your own CSS. Simply upload the team’s logo and add the player roster, and you’ve got yourself a great looking team page!

In addition to your team pages, the color scheme you assign to each team is automatically applied to all of their players pages! Using the Team Colors module, a player’s profile instantly reflect the colors of the primary team they belong to, saving you heaps of time and takes away the hassle of customizing hundreds of profile pages.

= Multisite =

Multisite is the perfect module for websites with different sports or leagues who want their team sites on subdomains of their main site. Multisite enables you to share widgets from any sites within your network. Whether you’re managing multiple sports or multiple teams, you can maintain all your websites from one place.

Build a central site to show what’s happening in each of your sports leagues. Multisite is great for athletic departments and sports bloggers who have multiple different sports teams and want to manage it from one website. This module gives you widgets to pull data from any site in your network, so you can easily create a central hub to show what’s happening.

Multisite can also help you create websites for all of your teams without the hassle of managing each one. This is perfect for creating league sites with multiple teams, similar to how sites like NBA.com and MLB.com work. Create one main site to manage all the data, and use widgets to display that data on each subdomain.

= Staff Directories =

The staff directories modules adds new fields to staff pages so you can add their email address and phone numbers. From the front-end, your visitors can click to email or call directly from their mobile device.

Staff directories can be displayed in list or gallery formats. Lists will quickly give your visitors the information they need to get in touch with each person. Galleries are great for adding photos of your staff to team pages alongside the players.

= League Menu =

Select team logos to display in a special navigation bar that helps your visitors jump from one team to the next. Optionally display a custom logo that represents the league or organization as a whole.

= Branding =

Quickly customize the login screen by replacing the WordPress logo with your own.

Create your own default admin color palette for all logged-in users on your site. Impress your clients and teammates!

= Birthdays =

Birthdays can be added to player and staff records. Once added, each person's age is automatically calculated and can be displayed on their profile.

= Twitter =

Display Twitter feeds on your profile pages to increase engagement! Simply add Twitter handles to any of your player, staff, and team profile pages and SportsPress will instantly display their latest tweets.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic Installation =

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it.
2. Log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.
3. On the next page, click Upload Plugin at the top.
4. Select the downloaded plugin file and click Install Now. WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves uploading the plugin to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it.
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

To receive automatic updates, you'll need to activate SportsPress Pro by entering the license key from your purchase receipt. You can add your license key from the sidebar of the SportsPress screen in the dashboard.

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the event/team/player/staff/sponsor pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
